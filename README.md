# e# earlyMinds: AI-Powered Developmental Assessment Platform

> Revolutionizing early childhood development screening through intelligent technology that enables detection of autism and developmental delays 6+ months earlier than current clinical methods.

## 🎯 Problem We're Solving

- 1 in 36 children have autism, typically diagnosed at 4+ years despite early signs appearing by 18-24 months
- Current screening relies on subjective checklists and long specialist wait times
- Early intervention can save $1.4M per child in lifetime costs, but requires early detection
- Underserved communities lack access to specialized developmental screening

## 💡 Our Solution

**Clinical-grade developmental assessment through smartphone recordings**

- **Real-time guidance** for parents during video/audio capture
- **Multimodal AI analysis** combining computer vision + speech processing  
- **Evidence-based insights** powered by Stanford Clinical AI (CLMBR)
- **Seamless integration** with pediatric EHR systems via FHIR

## 🏗️ Technical Innovation

**Hybrid Edge/Cloud Architecture**
- **Mobile edge processing** (EarlyVision + EarlyListen) for real-time feedback
- **Cloud AI pipeline** (EarlyVision Pro + EarlyListen Pro) for clinical analysis
- **Adaptive algorithms** for personalized task selection and longitudinal tracking
- **HIPAA-compliant** infrastructure with privacy-preserving design

**Key Technologies:**
- AWS (Fargate, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Bedrock, Q)
- React Native, TypeScript, Python
- Stanford CLMBR for clinical reasoning
- Computer Vision + Audio ML for behavioral analysis
- FHIR/HL7 for healthcare interoperability
